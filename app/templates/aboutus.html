<h1>About Us</h1>
<div>

    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>I am Eric Nguyen, an aspiring software engineer and a food enthusiast as everyone should be. I am a senior in high school, yet I do not know how to cook, but I really want to learn. I want to see many foods come to life by my hands, but I am constrained by the money in my budget. I am sure many people are in my situation as well, so I have created this website.</p>

    <h2>What is our purpose?</h2>
    <p>The problem that many people face is the inability to cook and a small budget to spend ingredients on. This website seeks to address this problem by providing a platform for people to post and search for recipes within their budgets. People from different backgrounds get to share their cultures with others through recipes, and recipients get to have an expansive library of recipes, which they can keep in mind the next time they go grocery shopping.</p>

    <h2>Your Experience</h2>
    <p>After creating their profile, users may post their recipes or lurk around in search of some. When searching, users can easily navigate the recipes in front of them with the filtering tool. Tags for recipes they are looking for can be created or removed based on its current ingredients, categories, cuisine, and cost. Users can also favorite their recipes, saving them for later use.</p>
