        <p class="desc-div-who-div">I am Eric Nguyen, an aspiring software engineer and a food enthusiast as everyone should be. I am a senior in high school, yet I do not know how to cook, but I really want to learn. I want to see many foods come to life by my hands, but I am constrained by the money in my budget. I am sure many people are in my situation as well, so I created this website.</p>

        <p class="desc-div-who-div">The problem that many people face is the inability to cook and a small budget to spend ingredients on. This website seeks to address this problem by providing a platform for people to post and search for recipes within their budgets. People from different backgrounds get to share their cultures with others through recipes, and recipients get to have an expansive library of recipes, which they can keep in mind the next time they go grocery shopping.</p>
